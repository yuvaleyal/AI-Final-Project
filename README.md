The game is played on the black squares of the board.
White pieces are initialized at the top of the board, and black pieces are initialized at the bottom.
The game starts from the bottom-left corner, which is Black’s corner at A1, marked as (0,0).
The first index represents the rows, while the second index represents the columns.
Black pieces are initialized on rows 0-2, and white pieces on rows 5-7.

Rules:

	•	Capturing is always mandatory.
	•	A king can move one square in any direction.
	•	A regular piece can capture moving forward and can retreat backward for multiple captures.
